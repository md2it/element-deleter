# SUPPORT SURVEY

---

## Common logic

- Keep a successful action counter
- Show the survey only when the counter reaches or crosses 25
- Do not show the survey if any condition is true:
   - The user previously selected "Never ask"
   - The user already clicked "Star on GitHub"
   - The user already clicked "Rate in store"
- The survey may be shown again after the counter reset and a new threshold crossing
- Do not show the survey earlier than 60 days after the previous survey display
- Show the survey only after a successful scenario is complete

## Survey flow

### Was this extension useful?

- "Ask me later" closes the survey, resets the counter, and keeps survey logic active
- "Never ask" closes the survey and disables future surveys
- "No" opens "Sorry to hear that. You can send feedback"
- "Yes" opens "Thank you. You can support the project"

### Thank you. You can support the project

- "Later" closes the survey, resets the counter, and keeps survey logic active
- "Star on GitHub" opens the project GitHub page and marks the survey as completed
- "Rate in store" opens the installed store listing and marks the survey as completed

### Sorry to hear that. You can send feedback

- "Send an email" opens `mailto:contact@md2it.com`
- "Later" closes the survey, resets the counter, and keeps survey logic active
- "Never ask" closes the survey and disables future surveys

## Window behavior

- Every survey window has a close button
- The close button works as "Ask me later" or "Later"
- Survey windows close only by explicit controls
- Clicking outside the survey does not close it

## Element Deleter rules

- Counter tick:
   - A successful deletion scenario where at least one element was deleted
   - The user then explicitly closes the extension by extension icon or hotkey
- Survey window:
   - A separate popup, not part of the main popup
- Survey trigger:
   - Immediately after the successful scenario is complete, if the counter reached the threshold
